  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

  <p>When I'm not writing code or studying, I enjoy spending time doing things that recharge my energy and spark my creativity. Here are some of my favorite hobbies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🚴‍♂️ Cycling – I love exploring new places on my bike, especially during my commute to work or when I'm on delivery routes.</li>
    <li>📸 Recording biking adventures – I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PedalPebaCariri" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> to share my rides with friends and family.</li>
    <li>🎮 Gaming – I enjoy games that challenge my logic and reflexes (and sometimes just help me relax).</li>
    <li>📚 Reading tech blogs – I’m always curious about new tools, especially in the .NET and C# ecosystem.</li>
    <li>🧉 Hanging out with family – Especially Cleide and Pedro, my biggest motivation to keep improving every day.</li>
  </ul>
